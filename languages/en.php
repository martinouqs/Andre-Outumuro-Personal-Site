	'P1'=>'Although his curiosity for music was made apparent long ago, it wasn’t until he was eight years
	old that he picked up a saxophone at the conservatory in his hometown of Celanova. Shortly after, he
	became a part of the municipal music band that bore the same name.',
	'P2'=>'He first studied classical music, however, by the age of 20 he began to feel more attracted to
	jazz, thanks to Paco Charlín at the Permanent Jazz Seminar of Pontevedra. This made him decide to
	move to A Coruña to train with Roberto Somoza at the Conservatory of Music of said city, and then later
	to study at the LUCA School of Arts in Belgium under the tutelage of teachers such as Frank Vaganée
	from the Brussels Jazz Orchestra and Dré Pallamaerts, a professor at the Conservatoire Supérieure de
	Paris. During which time, he received additional training from artists such as Chris Cheek, Sherman Irby,
	Ben van Gelder and Dayna Stephens.',
	'P3'=>'As a performer he stands out for his versatility. Although he specializes in modern music, he also
	regularly collaborates with groups that perform traditional, folk, classical, or even dance music. He has
	also worked in the field of education as a teacher at the Conservatorio Mayeusis and several secondary
	schools. Moreover, he is a graduate from the University of Vigo in Business Administration and
	Management and holds a master’s degree in Teachers Training from the University of A Coruña.',
